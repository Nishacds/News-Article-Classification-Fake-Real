# 📰 Fake News Classification using NLP

> A Machine Learning project that classifies news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using NLP techniques and provides explanations via an interactive web interface.


## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques. The model is trained using a labeled dataset, and the predictions are visualized through a beautiful, user-friendly **Streamlit GUI**.



## ✨ Features
- ✅ Clean and preprocessed news article data using NLTK
- ✅ TF-IDF Vectorization for feature extraction
- ✅ Logistic Regression model for classification
- ✅ Single article prediction with explanation
- ✅ Bulk prediction from uploaded CSV
- ✅ Animated GUI with Galaxy/Cyberpunk theme
- ✅ Downloadable text and CSV result reports
