# üì∞ News Article Classification (Fake/Real)

## üîç About the Project

This project presents an intelligent system designed to classify news articles as either **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. With the proliferation of misinformation across digital platforms, especially on social media, the need for automated and accurate fake news detection tools has become more pressing than ever. This project not only addresses that need but also offers a user-friendly and visually engaging interface.

## üéØ Objective

To develop a robust machine learning pipeline that can accurately detect fake news articles and present the results through an interactive and visually appealing GUI, providing not only a verdict but also meaningful insight into the prediction.

## üß† Problem Statement

Misinformation and fake news have become global concerns due to their potential to manipulate public opinion and influence socio-political landscapes. Manual verification is time-consuming and often inefficient. The goal is to automate this process through AI and provide transparent and explainable predictions.

## üí° Proposed Solution

Our solution involves building a supervised learning model trained on labeled news articles. We use Natural Language Processing for text cleaning and preprocessing, transform the content into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, and then classify the news using a Logistic Regression model. An engaging Streamlit web interface allows users to test the classifier live.

## üß™ Model Training Workflow

1. **Dataset Acquisition**: A labeled dataset containing real and fake news articles is sourced from Kaggle.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning the news content by removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, tokenizing, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Using TF-IDF to convert text into numerical feature vectors.
4. **Model Training**: Training a Logistic Regression model on the processed dataset.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
6. **Model Deployment**: Integration into a Streamlit-based user interface for live testing and demonstration.
